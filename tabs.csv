","If you want direct access to the APIs, or are using tools other than Javascript, you can still use the Census API directly instead of the CitySDK. ",View the CitySDK Getting Started Guide,,,,Geography,"You can access shape files, which are boundaries for common geographic entities like states, counties, cities, and more.  This can help provide context when building a mapping app.  ","You can also geocode a location to another format, for example, pass in a mailing address and get back a lat/lon pair that corresponds to that address.",The CitySDK makes it easy to get these geographic boundaries in GeoJSON formats which can easily be consumed by mapping tools like Google Maps and Leaflet JS.  ,View the CitySDK Docs related to Geography:,View the TigerWeb API,View the Geocoder API,,People,"You can access shape files, which are boundaries for common geographic entities like states, counties, cities, and more.
